My main website - collection of my own best and funniest websites!

List:

-   Texas Holdem: still working on it (for several months .\_.)
-   Wordles: list of wordle-like games. Brief description:
    -   Wordle: standard wordke
    -   Colorle: standard wordle, but instead of green, yellow and grey, you get random colors every game
    -   Blindle: the first 5 guesses are shown only at your last guess
    -   Word500: you only know how many of each color you got. You get 8 guesses instead of 6
    -   Randle: each **row** has a special event. The last row is notmal wordle
    -   Randle2: each **column** has an event. You get 8 guesses instead of 6
    -   Alphabetle: instead of yellows, you get whether the letter in the spot is higher or lower in the alphabet
    -   Absurdle: the answer changes dynamically. You get 8 guesses instead of 6
    -   Verticalle: you start vertically. Only the last guess is normal
    -   Numberle: numbers instead of words!
-   Math: some maths helpers:
    -   Polynomial multiplication: enter a product of polynomials and compite it! [!IMPORTANT] Always put parenthesis () around each term
-   Enigma machine: type text using lower keyboard (or computers keyboard) and the encoded key will lighten up on the upper keyboard (it is also registered in the field on top). You can choose rotors and reflectors and edit the plugboard in settings
-   Pong: the old good Pong game. Play PvP or (sooner) PvE. There are powerups which you are (will) be able to disable in settings. Ball speed has a chance (40%) to increase after player hits the ball. List of powerups:
    -   ball redirection: changed vertical speed of the ball randomly
    -   bigger platform: increases size of the platform by 75% for 5 sec
    -   smaller platform: decreases size of the platform by 75% for 5 sec
    -   extra ball: adds another ball from the middle of the board which flies in the _opposite_ direction
    -   faster movement speed: increases player movement speed by 50% for 5 sec
    -   slower movement speed: decreases player movement speed by 50% for 5 sec
    -   smaller ball: decreases size of **all** balls by 50% for 5 sec
    -   speed refresh: decreases speed of **all** balls. (For math nerds: new_speed = ceil(sqrt(old_speed)))
-   TicTacToeX: my own version of tictactoe with different settings
